This document describes the Jenzabar Application Data Integration (JADI) Accounts Receivable - Student Financial Clearance Workflow Customization. The modules  described below are a set of tools to assist the student accounts office in the following areas:       1.   Instant assessment of all students’ financial clearance viability for the current            semester’s enrollment sprint.       2.   Replicates an on-premises subset of key AR data to minimize latency and optimize            response times in a high-traffic environment.       3.     Provides operator tools for (a) immediate review of student financial status,            adjustment, registration, and automatic archiving of resulting transactions.       4.   Synchronizes relevant data with the Automatic Telephone Attendant (ATA) that allows            students to determine their financial clearance status, submit credit card payments, or            request refunds via telephone.       5.   Provides a smart MS windows application for rapid posting of repetitive transactions.        6.   Implement a windows service that monitors the 80% automatic clearance utility and            notifies customers when their financial clearance has been approved or revoked. It also            advises the billing supervisor of any account anomalies encountered.         7.   Numerous Statistical Analysis utilities allow critical financial clearance statistics to be            surfaced on demand so that targeted responses can be made to assist students in            financially qualifying.    Jenzabar is a data repository for the administrative processes of the university. However, as in  most cases, customization is required to achieve complete functionality for the organization.  This requires a rigorous understanding of Microsoft SQL Server. To that end, JADI is a collection                                                                                                                         1 of views, table subsets, stored procedures, Visual Studio programs, maintenance plans, VBA   activated EXCEL spreadsheets to provide the Oakwood University Student Finance Office with  the necessary tools to manage their receivables.          1.
